    In this year just today i was very proud of my self, I had a Fever on the 2nd day of exam then i prayed and hoped to feel better on the 3rd day (which is today) and i did feel well,
      but I'm now facing 4 exams and 1 test which makes it harder but i didn't stress, since i have my reasons but i still go for it
    and well i didn't expect to answer that many questions and i'm glad that i got a speedy recovery

  <p>
    depends on the subject, but i often listen to music or do 10mins break if nothing is popping on my mind while studying

    <h2>What’s a mistake you made in the past that you’ve learned from?</h2>

  <p>
    'Life doesn't always flow in your own way' i learned that the hard way, unfriending my old classmates just because they don't talk to me
    I was a selfish ignorant kid back then, now I got anxiety because of my actions.
